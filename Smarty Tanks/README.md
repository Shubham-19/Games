# Smarty Tanks

This is a game that I developed as a project in my college.

The function 'gameIntro' won't work as there was a image file that I can't find, so keep that line commented in the code.
Also, there are some more comments in the code that I used while debugging the code, so you can also avoid them.

A lot of changes can be made to this code, especially we can make it a little more object oriented, so if you come across
this code and want something similar to it or if you download the code then, please try to make this more object oriented.
